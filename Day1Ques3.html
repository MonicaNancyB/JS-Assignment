            <h1>JavaScript Types are Dynamic</h1>
            JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types:<br>
           <h2>1.JavaScript Strings</h2>
            A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe".
            Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes <br>
        <h2>2.JavaScript Numbers</h2>
            JavaScript has only one type of numbers.
            Numbers can be written with, or without decimals<br>
            <h2>3.JavaScript Booleans</h2>
                Booleans can only have two values: true or false.<br>
                <h2>4.JavaScript Arrays</h2>
JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.
Array items are separated by commas.<br>
<h2>5.JavaScript Objects</h2>
    JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.
    Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.<br>
<h2>6..The typeof Operator</h2>
    You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable.
    The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression:<br>
<h2>7.Undefined</h2>
    In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.<br>
    <h2>8..Empty Values</h2>
        An empty value has nothing to do with undefined.
        An empty string has both a legal value and a type.    <br>
        <h2>9.Null</h2>
            In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.
            Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.
            You can consider it a bug in JavaScript that typeof null is an object. It should be null.
            You can empty an object by setting it to null<br>
